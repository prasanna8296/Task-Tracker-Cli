## Installation

To install and run the Task Tracker CLI, ensure you have Golang installed, then follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abneed/task-tracker-cli.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd task-tracker-cli

# Build the application
go build -o task-cli

# Run the application
./task-cli
```

## Usage
Here’s how you can use the various commands:

### Add a Task
```bash
./task-cli add "Your task description"
```

### Update a Task
```bash
./task-cli update <task_id> "Updated task description"
```

### Delete a Task
```bash
./task-cli delete <task_id>
```

### Marking a task as "in-progress" or "done"
```bash

## Task Storage

Tasks are stored in a JSON file located in the project directory. This allows for easy persistence and manipulation of task data.

In case the JSON file doesn't exist, the application will generate that directory and store the JSON file automatically in `db/tasks.json`.
