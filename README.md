# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/abneed/task-tracker-cli.git

# Navigate to the project directory

go build -o task-cli

# Run the application

```

## Usage
Hereâ€™s how you can use the various commands:

### Add a Task

```

### Update a Task
```bash
./task-cli update <task_id> "Updated task description"
```

### Delete a Task

```

### Marking a task as "in-progress" or "done"

## Task Storage

Tasks are stored in a JSON file located in the project directory. This allows for easy persistence and manipulation of task data.

In case the JSON file doesn't exist, the application will generate that directory and store the JSON file automatically in `db/tasks.json`.
